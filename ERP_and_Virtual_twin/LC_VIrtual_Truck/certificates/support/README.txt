These certificates are here to support a legacy version of our code, where Arrowhead Systems had a "system group" field, which was also present in the certificate common names.

Keystore certificates have the following common name structure in this folder: <system_name>.<system_group>.<cloud_name>.<operator>.arrowhead.eu
