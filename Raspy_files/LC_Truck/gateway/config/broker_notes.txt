Our broker module is running on RabbitMQ. A setup guide can be found on these links:

If creating channel failed while the rabbitmq server running:

 Use the root user (su) to type these following commands:
    - In case of:  "Error: unable to connect to node <NODENAME>: nodedown"
    1. systemctl stop rabbitmq-server
    2. ps -ef | grep rabbit
    3. kill <PID>
    4. rabbitmqctl stop
    5. cd /etc/init.d
    6. systemctl start rabbitmq-server
    7. Check: service --status-all or rabbitmqctl status
    
    -In case of: "Stopping and halting node <NODENAME>" - Step 6.-7. above

    -In case the service is not starting, make sure every process run by rabbit-mq is killed before trying to start it.
     Specially the "epmd" process (ps -ef | grep epmd)
     Firewalls may also block one of the underlying process of the rabbitmq process. If the service is not starting, and
     you see the following error message in "journal -xe": "Protocol 'inet_tcp': register/listen error: etimedout", then
     most likely it is a problem caused by the firewall.
